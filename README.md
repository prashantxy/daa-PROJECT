# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

This web application visualizes various sorting algorithms in action. Users can choose between different sorting algorithms and control the speed of the sorting process. This project is great for understanding the underlying mechanics of sorting algorithms in an interactive and engaging way.

## Live Demo

You can access a live demo of the sorting visualizer [here](#).

## Features

- **Four Sorting Algorithms**:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Quick Sort
  - Insertion Sort
- **Dynamic Array Size**: Adjust the number of elements in the array for sorting.
- **Adjustable Speed**: Control the speed of the sorting animation.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Watch as the bars representing array elements change positions during sorting.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: To structure the web page.
- **CSS3**: For styling and animations.
- **JavaScript**: For the core sorting logic and UI interaction.

## How It Works

- The application generates a random array of numbers, represented by vertical bars of varying heights.
- Users can select the desired sorting algorithm from the dropdown and hit the "Start" button.
- The selected algorithm will be visualized with the ability to adjust the speed of sorting.
